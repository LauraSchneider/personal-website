Our programming journey started together when we met at SPICED Academy, a coding bootcamp in Berlin. We hit it off from the first week and been inseparable ever since! Bellow you will find the tech stack we have been trained in as well as some of the projects we worked on during our time SPICED. Feel free to get in touch with either one of us below.</p><br>
